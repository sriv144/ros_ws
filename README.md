## 🚀 Getting Started

To get this workspace set up on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Ubuntu 20.04** (or your specific Linux distribution).
* **ROS Noetic Ninjemys** (or the ROS version you are using). You can find installation instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu).
* **Catkin Tools**: `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-catkin python3-catkin-tools`

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    * Clone this repository into the `src` folder of your Catkin workspace. If you don't have one, create it first.
    ```sh
    # Create a new catkin workspace
    mkdir -p ~/my_ros_ws/src
    cd ~/my_ros_ws/

    # Clone the repository into the src folder
    git clone [https://github.com/sriv144/ros_ws.git](https://github.com/sriv144/ros_ws.git) src/ros_ws
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    * Use `rosdep` to install any missing package dependencies.
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the root of your workspace
    cd ~/my_ros_ws

    # Install dependencies
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```

3.  **Build the Workspace**
    * Use `catkin_make` or `catkin build` to compile the packages.
    ```sh
    # Using catkin_make
    catkin_make

    # OR using catkin build
    catkin build
    ```

4.  **Source the Workspace**
    * Before you can use the packages, you need to source the setup file.
    ```sh
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```
    * **Tip:** Add this command to your `~/.bashrc` file to source it automatically in every new terminal.
    ```sh
    echo "source ~/my_ros_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

## 🎮 How to Use

To run a specific functionality, use `roslaunch`. For example:

```sh
# Example of launching a simulation
roslaunch your_package_name your_launch_file.launch
